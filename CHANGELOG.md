# Changelog

All notable changes to tooltrust-scanner are documented here.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [0.1.15] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- **AS-013**: Removed near-duplicate (`TOOL_SHADOWING_NEAR`) detection, which
  had a 13/13 false-positive rate in production. Intra-server near-duplicates
  are intentional API design — get/set pairs (`get-active-layer`/`set-active-layer`),
  data-granularity variants (`getCryptocurrency5MinuteData`/`getCryptocurrency1MinuteData`),
  and indicator variants (`getEMA`/`getSMA`/`getWMA`) all differ by exactly
  one edit and are not attacks. AS-013 now fires only on exact normalized-name
  duplicates, which are unambiguously problematic. Typo-based impersonation
  is handled by AS-009 (Typosquatting), which has a purpose-built corpus.
- Regression tests added for all 13 false positive cases.

---

## [0.1.14] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- **AS-009**: Eliminated 12/12 false positives observed in production scans.
  Three targeted heuristic improvements:
  1. **Prefix-extension skip**: if one normalized name is a prefix of the other
     (e.g. `create_relation` / `create_relations`), skip — these are legitimate
     singular/plural tool families, not impersonations.
  2. **Distance-2 length floor raised** from 10 to 15 normalized chars: generic
     `verb_noun` patterns (`list_comments` vs `list_commits`, `pg_describe_table`
     vs `describe_table`, `create_field` vs `create_file`) no longer trigger.
  3. **Same-length distance-1 threshold**: substitution-type typos on short names
     (`git_tag` vs `get_tag`, `git_commit` vs `get_commit`, `search_notes` vs
     `search_nodes`) are now skipped when both names normalize to fewer than 12
     chars. Insertion/deletion typos (different lengths) are always flagged.
- Regression tests added for all 12 false positive cases.

## [0.1.13] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- **MCP parser**: The JSON Schema `"type"` field may be either a plain string
  (`"string"`) or an array of strings (`["string","null"]`) per the JSON Schema
  spec. The MCP adapter now handles both via a new `FlexType` unmarshaler.
  Previously, Smithery-hosted tools such as `googlesheets` caused a hard parse
  error (`cannot unmarshal array into Go struct field … of type string`), silently
  skipping the tool in the directory pipeline.

---

## [0.1.12] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- **AS-010**: Removed bare `"pass"` from the secret-param pattern list. It matched
  `passenger`, `bypass`, `passthrough`, `pass_count`, `compass`, producing false
  positives on common non-secret parameters. Replaced with `"passphrase"`.
- **AS-001**: Tightened `system:` regex from `(?i)system\s*:` to `(?im)^\s*system\s*:`
  so it only matches at the start of a line. Prose like
  "Monitors system: CPU, RAM, disk" no longer triggers a finding.
- **AS-001**: The bare `exfiltrate` pattern now requires a direct object
  (`data`, `info`, `credentials`, `secrets`, `content`, or `results`) within two words,
  preventing false positives on defensive security tools that mention "exfiltration".

### Added
- Regression tests for all three false-positive fixes above.

---

## [0.1.11] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **AS-009 Typosquatting checker**: detects tool names that closely resemble known
  legitimate tools using edit-distance heuristics.
- **AS-013 Tool Shadowing checker**: flags tools whose names or descriptions appear
  designed to shadow or override higher-priority tools in an agent's tool list.
- **AS-006**: Catch additional false negatives — `run-code` and `run_shortcut` patterns
  now detected.
- ToolTrust shield + Celtic knot logo SVG (`docs/logo.svg`) matching the site's
  emerald color scheme (`#10B981`).

### Fixed
- **AS-006**: Added word boundaries to backtick shell-execution pattern to prevent
  substring false positives.
- **AS-006**: Removed false positive on "execute arbitrary query/request/operation"
  phrasing used in legitimate database/API tools.

---

## [0.1.10] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- Regression tests for AS-006 real-production false positives.

---

## [0.1.9] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- **AS-006**: Additional false positive removed — "execute arbitrary query/request/operation".
- **AS-006**: Word-boundary fix for backtick shell pattern.

---

## [0.1.8] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- **AS-006**: Removed false positive on "execute arbitrary query/request/operation".

---

## [0.1.7] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **AS-001**: Phase 1 false-positive reduction — confidence tiers and tool-name
  allowlist. Data-movement tools (email, reply, forward, …) no longer trigger
  broad exfiltration patterns. Patterns downgraded to Medium severity.

### Fixed
- **AS-001**: Tightened data-exfiltration regex to require an explicit external-
  destination indicator (`https://`, `external`, `remote`, `attacker`, `base64`).

---

## [0.1.6] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- Per-grade action guide printed below scan results in the CLI.
- Actionable issue hints per rule ID (`ruleHint` map in CLI).
- GitHub Actions workflow to auto-update the Homebrew formula on release.

### Fixed
- **AS-002** and **AS-006** recommendation text made actionable with specific
  guidance (enum validation, `approval_required: true`).
- Added `tooltrust-mcp` binary to `.gitignore`.

### Changed
- `--help` output slimmed down; `-r`/`--rules` flag added for full rule catalog.
- `-v` flag added for version output.

## [0.1.5] and earlier

Initial releases establishing the core scanning engine with rules AS-001 through
AS-011. See git log for full history.
