# IOC Pipeline

ToolTrust now supports a small, curated IOC feed for supply-chain detection.

This document defines how threat-intel findings move from blog posts or advisories
into scanner-enforced data files such as:

- `pkg/analyzer/data/blacklist.json`
- `pkg/analyzer/data/npm_iocs.json`

## Goals

- Keep IOC updates data-driven instead of editing Go logic for every incident
- Separate low-confidence candidate intel from scanner-enforced detections
- Require human review before promoting new blocking or critical rules

## Current Data Files

### `pkg/analyzer/data/blacklist.json`

Use for:

- confirmed malicious versions
- confirmed compromised releases
- known-bad version ranges with strong public attribution

These entries typically map to `AS-008`.

### `pkg/analyzer/data/npm_iocs.json`

Use for:

- malicious IOC package names
- known dropper/helper package names
- metadata-level indicators that can be detected without tarball scanning

These entries currently map to `AS-016`.

Supported npm IOC types currently include:
- `package_name`
- `dependency_name`
- `script_pattern`
- `domain`
- `url`

## Candidate Flow

1. Threat-intel monitor opens an issue for a new incident or blog post.
2. The daily OSV `MAL-` monitor opens a review-only digest PR under `.github/ioc-candidates/review/`.
   - These are **OSV `MAL-` records** — confirmed malicious packages from OpenSSF malicious-packages,
     Amazon Inspector, GitHub Advisory, and similar sources — not ordinary CVEs.
   - Ordinary CVEs are covered by AS-004 real-time OSV lookup and must not flow through this path.
3. Maintainer reviews the digest PR and picks high-value entries to promote.
4. Candidate is classified:
   - `promote_to: blacklist` — for confirmed malicious versions worth adding to AS-008
   - `promote_to: npm_iocs` — for suspicious package name indicators
   - `promote_to: watch_only` — when attribution is weak or AS-004 coverage is sufficient
5. Maintainer adds the reviewed entry to the scanner data file.
6. Tests are updated to cover the new signal.
7. A scanner release/tag is cut so ToolTrust Directory can consume the update.

The daily OSV monitor is intentionally not an automatic promotion path. It
should not modify `pkg/analyzer/data/blacklist.json` or
`pkg/analyzer/data/npm_iocs.json` directly.

Division of responsibility:
- **Ordinary CVEs** (RCE, SSRF, IDOR, hardcoded secrets, etc.) → AS-004 real-time OSV lookup
- **Confirmed malicious packages** (`MAL-` records) → this pipeline collects + human promotes → AS-008

## Promotion Helper

ToolTrust includes a small helper for the most common promotion path:

```bash
go run ./cmd/tooltrust-ioc-promote .github/ioc-candidates.example.json
```

Current behavior:

- validates basic candidate structure
- promotes `promote_to: npm_iocs` entries into `pkg/analyzer/data/npm_iocs.json`
- promotes `promote_to: blacklist` entries into `pkg/analyzer/data/blacklist.json` when version and action fields are present
- skips unsupported candidate types rather than guessing

This keeps the first promotion path simple and deterministic. Promotion into
`blacklist.json` remains intentionally stricter than IOC promotion: confirmed
versions, action, severity, and a stable blacklist identifier are required.

## Candidate Schema

Candidate IOC files should validate against:

- `.github/ioc-candidates.schema.json`

Recommended fields:

- `ecosystem`
- `ioc_type`
- `value`
- `confidence`
- `reason`
- `source`
- `first_seen`
- `suggested_action`
- `promote_to`

Example candidate entry:

```json
{
  "ecosystem": "npm",
  "ioc_type": "package_name",
  "value": "plain-crypto-js",
  "confidence": "high",
  "reason": "Observed in the malicious axios npm publish on March 31, 2026.",
  "source": "https://example.com/incident-writeup",
  "first_seen": "2026-03-31",
  "suggested_action": "flag",
  "promote_to": "npm_iocs"
}
```

## Promotion Rules

Promote to `blacklist.json` when:

- a specific version or version range is confirmed malicious
- public attribution is strong enough to justify blocking
- the action should be immediate and deterministic

Promote to `npm_iocs.json` when:

- the IOC is a suspicious package or metadata indicator
- it can appear across multiple compromised publishes
- it is useful even when the final malicious version is not yet blacklisted

Keep as `watch_only` when:

- attribution is weak
- only one unverified report exists
- the signal is too noisy for scanner enforcement
- the advisory is a normal CVE/RCE/IDOR/sandbox escape/hardcoded secret without
  evidence of malicious or compromised package publication

## What This Does Not Cover Yet

- full tarball signature scanning
- JS source-code fingerprinting
- fuzzy matching over obfuscated payloads
- automatic promotion from issue feed to blocking rules

Those should come later, after the candidate data flow is stable.
