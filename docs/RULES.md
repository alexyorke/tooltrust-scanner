# Security Rules

ToolTrust Scanner currently ships **18** active built-in rules: **16** tool-definition rules and **2** source-scan rules for embedded MCP implementations.
Each rule fires independently; a tool or repository can trigger multiple rules.

---

## 🚨 AS-001 — Prompt Injection / Tool Poisoning

**Severity:** Critical

Detects malicious instructions hidden in tool names or descriptions that attempt to hijack the agent's reasoning, override system prompts, or redirect behavior toward attacker-controlled goals.

Common patterns: `ignore previous instructions`, `system:`, role-override language, and base64-encoded payloads intended to override the agent's instructions.

---

## ⚠️ AS-002 — Excessive Permissions

**Severity:** High / Low (depends on permission type)

Flags tools that declare broad capabilities — filesystem access, network access, database access, or arbitrary code execution — without a clear, scoped justification.

Permissions checked: `exec`, `network`, `fs`, `db`.

---

## 🔀 AS-003 — Scope Mismatch

**Severity:** High

Fires when a tool's name implies one capability but its description or schema claims another. Example: a tool called `read_file` that also declares network write access.

---

## 📦 AS-004 — Supply Chain CVEs (OSV)

**Severity:** High / Critical

Queries the [OSV vulnerability database](https://osv.dev) for known CVEs in packages declared as dependencies. Requires network access during scan; results are cached per run.

---

## 🔐 AS-005 — Privilege Escalation

**Severity:** High

Detects tools that request or claim `admin`, `root`, `sudo`, or elevated permission scopes beyond what the tool's stated purpose requires.

---

## 💻 AS-006 — Arbitrary Code Execution

**Severity:** Critical

Flags tools whose name or description implies the ability to run arbitrary host commands, scripts, or code. Patterns include `exec`, `eval`, `shell`, `run_code`, `execute_script`, backtick shell syntax.

---

## ℹ️ AS-007 — Missing Description or Schema

**Severity:** Info

Tools with no description or no input schema give the agent no basis for safe use. Flagged as informational — not a security risk by itself, but a quality signal.

---

## 🚨 AS-008 — Known-Compromised Packages (Offline Blacklist)

**Severity:** Critical

Checks an offline bundled blacklist of packages confirmed to have been compromised in supply chain attacks. No network required — zero latency.

Current blacklist: LiteLLM 1.82.7/1.82.8 (TeamPCP `.pth` backdoor), Trivy v0.69.4–v0.69.6 (CI pipeline compromise), Langflow < 1.9.0 (unauthenticated RCE), Axios 1.14.1/0.30.4 (malicious npm publish), Bitwarden CLI 2026.4.0, compromised `@cap-js/*` releases, and Mini Shai-Hulud/TanStack-related compromised npm/PyPI package versions.

---

## 🎭 AS-009 — Typosquatting

**Severity:** Medium

Uses edit-distance heuristics to detect tool names that closely resemble known legitimate tools — a common technique for impersonation attacks. Tuned to avoid false positives on legitimate plural/variant tool families.

---

## 🔑 AS-010 — Insecure Secret Handling

**Severity:** Medium

Flags tools whose input parameters appear designed to accept secrets (API keys, tokens, passwords) in plaintext rather than via environment variables or secret stores.

---

## ℹ️ AS-011 — Missing Rate-Limit / Timeout

**Severity:** Low

Tools that perform network or execution operations without declaring rate-limit, timeout, or retry configuration can cause runaway agent behavior or denial-of-service conditions.

---

## 👥 AS-013 — Tool Shadowing

**Severity:** High / Medium

Detects tools whose names are exact normalized duplicates of other tools in the same server — a sign that a malicious tool is attempting to shadow or override a legitimate one.

Near-duplicate detection (edit distance 1) was removed in v0.1.15 after a 13/13 false-positive rate on legitimate tool families. Only exact normalized duplicates fire this rule.

---

## ℹ️ AS-014 — Dependency Inventory Unavailable

**Severity:** Info

Flags MCP tools that do not expose `metadata.dependencies` and do not provide a `repo_url`, which limits ToolTrust's ability to perform meaningful supply-chain analysis.

---

## ⚠️ AS-015 — Suspicious NPM Lifecycle Script

**Severity:** Medium / High

Flags npm dependency versions that publish install-time lifecycle scripts such as `preinstall`, `install`, `postinstall`, or `prepare`. Severity rises when the script contains remote-fetch or inline-execution patterns.

---

## 🚨 AS-016 — Suspicious NPM IOC Dependency

**Severity:** Critical

Flags npm dependency versions whose published registry metadata or install-time scripts reference known malicious IOC package names, domains, URLs, or script patterns, such as `plain-crypto-js`, `@tanstack/setup`, Mini Shai-Hulud infrastructure, or reviewed shell-fetch indicators. This is narrower than full tarball signature scanning, but it can still catch compromised releases when an IOC appears in dependency metadata.

---

## ⚠️ AS-017 — Suspicious Data Exfiltration Description

**Severity:** Medium

Flags tool descriptions that explicitly suggest forwarding user data, content, or conversation history to external endpoints such as remote hosts, external servers, attacker-controlled URLs, or base64-encoded sinks. This is intentionally separate from AS-001 so prompt-injection findings stay focused on instruction override language.

---

## ℹ️ AS-018 — Embedded MCP Server Detected

**Severity:** Info

Flags repositories where MCP SDK imports and server initialization are present in source code, but the scanner could not enumerate tool definitions from a manifest or live handshake.

This is a presence signal, not a clean bill of health. It tells you the repo likely exposes MCP functionality, but more review is needed to understand tools, auth, and scope.

---

## 🚨 AS-019 — Unauthenticated MCP Route Exposure

**Severity:** High / Critical

Flags embedded MCP HTTP servers where one route reaches the MCP handler without the authentication middleware applied on another route serving the same handler.

The initial implementation focuses on Go/Gin-style route registrations and raises severity when it sees strong exploitability signals such as:

- an unauthenticated alternate MCP route like `/mcp_message`
- fail-open IP allowlist logic
- the same handler used by both authenticated and unauthenticated MCP endpoints
