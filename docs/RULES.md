# Security Rules

ToolTrust Scanner checks every MCP tool against **12 built-in rules** (AS-001 through AS-011 and AS-013).
Each rule fires independently; a tool can trigger multiple rules.

**Note:** AS-012 (Tool Drift) is described below as **planned**—it is **not** executed by the engine yet (`pkg/analyzer` has no AS-012 checker).

---

## 🚨 AS-001 — Prompt Injection / Tool Poisoning

**Severity:** Critical

Detects malicious instructions hidden in tool names or descriptions that attempt to hijack the agent's reasoning, override system prompts, or redirect behavior toward attacker-controlled goals.

Common patterns: `ignore previous instructions`, `system:`, `exfiltrate data to`, role-override language, base64-encoded payloads.

---

## ⚠️ AS-002 — Excessive Permissions

**Severity:** High / Low (depends on permission type)

Flags tools that declare broad capabilities — filesystem access, network access, database access, or arbitrary code execution — without a clear, scoped justification.

Permissions checked: `exec`, `network`, `fs`, `db`.

---

## 🔀 AS-003 — Scope Mismatch

**Severity:** High

Fires when a tool's name implies one capability but its description or schema claims another. Example: a tool called `read_file` that also declares network write access.

---

## 📦 AS-004 — Supply Chain CVEs (OSV)

**Severity:** High / Critical

Queries the [OSV vulnerability database](https://osv.dev) for known CVEs in packages declared as dependencies. Requires network access during scan; results are cached per run.

---

## 🔐 AS-005 — Privilege Escalation

**Severity:** High

Detects tools that request or claim `admin`, `root`, `sudo`, or elevated permission scopes beyond what the tool's stated purpose requires.

---

## 💻 AS-006 — Arbitrary Code Execution

**Severity:** Critical

Flags tools whose name or description implies the ability to run arbitrary host commands, scripts, or code. Patterns include `exec`, `eval`, `shell`, `run_code`, `execute_script`, backtick shell syntax.

---

## ℹ️ AS-007 — Missing Description or Schema

**Severity:** Info

Tools with no description or no input schema give the agent no basis for safe use. Flagged as informational — not a security risk by itself, but a quality signal.

---

## 🚨 AS-008 — Known-Compromised Packages (Offline Blacklist)

**Severity:** Critical

Checks an offline bundled blacklist of packages confirmed to have been compromised in supply chain attacks. No network required — zero latency.

Current blacklist: LiteLLM 1.82.7/1.82.8 (TeamPCP `.pth` backdoor), Trivy v0.69.4–v0.69.6 (CI pipeline compromise), Langflow < 1.9.0 (unauthenticated RCE).

---

## 🎭 AS-009 — Typosquatting

**Severity:** Medium

Uses edit-distance heuristics to detect tool names that closely resemble known legitimate tools — a common technique for impersonation attacks. Tuned to avoid false positives on legitimate plural/variant tool families.

---

## 🔑 AS-010 — Insecure Secret Handling

**Severity:** Medium

Flags tools whose input parameters appear designed to accept secrets (API keys, tokens, passwords) in plaintext rather than via environment variables or secret stores.

---

## ℹ️ AS-011 — Missing Rate-Limit / Timeout

**Severity:** Low

Tools that perform network or execution operations without declaring rate-limit, timeout, or retry configuration can cause runaway agent behavior or denial-of-service conditions.

---

## 🔄 AS-012 — Tool Drift (planned, not implemented)

**Severity:** Medium (proposed)

**Status:** Not shipped. The scanner does not emit AS-012 findings today. This section documents the intended future rule for supply-chain and compliance workflows (detecting definition changes between scans).

When implemented, it would flag tools whose definitions change between scans—new parameters, modified descriptions, or expanded permissions—so teams can require human review (drift as a governance signal).

---

## 👥 AS-013 — Tool Shadowing

**Severity:** High / Medium

Detects tools whose names are exact normalized duplicates of other tools in the same server — a sign that a malicious tool is attempting to shadow or override a legitimate one.

Near-duplicate detection (edit distance 1) was removed in v0.1.15 after a 13/13 false-positive rate on legitimate tool families. Only exact normalized duplicates fire this rule.
