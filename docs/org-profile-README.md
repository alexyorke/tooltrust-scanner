# AgentSafe AI

**Making AI agents safe to use.**

AI agents are powerful — but every tool they call is an attack surface. Prompt injection, data exfiltration, privilege escalation, and supply chain attacks hide in tool descriptions that agents blindly trust.

We build open-source tools that let you see the risks before your agent acts on them.

### ToolTrust Scanner

Static security scanner for MCP server tool definitions. 16 active security rules, plus explicit supply-chain visibility signals for missing dependency data and transitive dependency coverage from common lockfiles. Battle-tested against hundreds of production servers.

```bash
# Add to your .mcp.json — your agent scans its own tools
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tooltrust": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "tooltrust-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then ask your agent: *"Run tooltrust_scan_config"*

### ToolTrust Directory

Public security registry for MCP servers. Every server gets a trust grade (A–F) based on automated scanning. Browse reports, check grades, and verify servers before you install them.

### What we detect

| Threat | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Prompt injection | Malicious instructions hidden in tool descriptions |
| Arbitrary code execution | Tools that run `eval()`, `exec()`, or arbitrary scripts |
| Data exfiltration | Tools that send data to external endpoints |
| Privilege escalation | Tools requesting admin/sudo/root access |
| Supply chain CVEs | Known vulnerabilities in server dependencies |
| Tool shadowing | Duplicate tool names designed to hijack agent behavior |
