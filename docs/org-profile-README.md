# AgentSafe AI

**We scanned 207 MCP servers. 70% have security issues.**

AI agents are powerful — but every tool they call is an attack surface. Prompt injection, data exfiltration, privilege escalation, and supply-chain backdoors hide in tool descriptions that agents blindly trust. We build open-source tools that expose the risks before your agent acts on them.

### ToolTrust Scanner

Open-source security scanner for MCP tool definitions. **12** rules active today (AS-012 tool drift documented, not yet shipped). Tested against 207+ production servers. Each tool gets a trust grade (A–F) and a gateway policy.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tooltrust": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "tooltrust-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then ask your agent: *"Run tooltrust_scan_config"*

### ToolTrust Directory

Public trust registry for MCP servers. Every server gets a grade based on automated scanning. Browse reports, compare grades, and verify servers before you install them.

### What we detect

| Threat | What happens |
|--------|-------------|
| Prompt injection | Malicious instructions hidden in tool descriptions hijack your agent |
| Arbitrary code execution | Tools run `eval()`, `exec()`, or scripts on your machine |
| Data exfiltration | Tools send your data to external endpoints |
| Privilege escalation | Tools grab admin/sudo/root access beyond their stated purpose |
| Supply-chain attacks | Known compromised packages (LiteLLM, Trivy, Langflow) |
| Tool shadowing | Duplicate tool names hijack agent behavior |

### The numbers

| | |
|-|-|
| 3,235 tools analyzed | 3,613 security findings |
| 70% of servers have issues | Only 10% get a clean Grade A |
| 16 servers allow arbitrary code execution | 97 tools leak secrets through plaintext params |
